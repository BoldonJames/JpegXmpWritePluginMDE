# JpegXmpWritePluginMDE
This repository is a copy of the pull request [#65](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-dotnet/pull/65) in metadata-extractor-dotnet and aims to compile it separately in a standalone library as a plugin to MDE. The intention is to expose the writing functionality for XMP in jpeg case. 

@michaelosthege is the original author of the PR and he permitted me to use his PR to create the plugin:
